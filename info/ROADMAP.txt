
1. Deleting ladders.

   Ladder table should have a 'enabled' or 'disabledTimestamp' columns. Deleting Ladders should just change
   the enabled flag. 
   
2. Transfering ownership. 

3. Optional messaging when challenging players. 

   Text field should be optional. Probably also best to persist the message in a database. 
   
4. Multiple comments for a match - both players should be able to add. May try to fit in the same match table rather
   than multiple tables.
   
5. Lengths of fields in the user registration form. There was a problem with validation of either address or postcode.

6. Ladders should also have city, country and postcode associated with them.  

7. Management console - changing the max diff for challenge flag.       

8. Search form more advanced. 

9. Ladder - new flag - search'able or not. Defaults to false. 

10. New check box in ladder management.
