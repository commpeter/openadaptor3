Fundamental infrastructure components and interfaces for OpenAdaptor.

<p>The Core Package contains the implementation of the fundamental OpenAdaptor components and concepts such as adaptor,
message passing, lifecyle management, transactionality and so on.</p>

<p>Core is where the fundamental OpenAdaptor interfaces are found. These are the interfaces implemented by Connectors,
DataProcessors and MessageProcessors etc.</p>

<p>Standard implementations of these interfaces are found in the auxil package. That package contains connectors and
processors which leverage the core infrastructure components. The package provides connector implementations which
provide support for key Java technologies such as JMS, JDBC, SOAP, Files, Sockets etc. Implementations of
DataProcessors are provided which work with data in XML and Record form.</p>
