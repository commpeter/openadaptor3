<!--
    This adaptor does the following...
    
      * subscribes to a subject
      * writes data to stdout
    
    It is designed to illustrate the basic structure of an adaptor that subscribes
    to rendezvous.

    Run it like this...
    
      java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config subscriber.xml -bean Adaptor
    
    You need the following in your classpath
  
      lib
      lib/openadaptor.jar
      lib/openadaptor-spring.jar
      lib/openadaptor-depends.jar
     
      tibrvj.jar (this is not distributed with openadaptor)
    
    tibrvj calls the native rendezvous installation, so this needs to be installed
    and the libraries need to be in your PATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
     
    Once it is running you need to publish a message, either by running the
    corresponding publisher example or using tibrvsend.
