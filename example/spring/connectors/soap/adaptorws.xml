<!--
    This adaptor does the following...
    
      * exposes a webservice that clients can send data to
      * writes data to stdout
    
    It is designed to illustrate the basic structure of exposing an adaptor as a
    web service, typically you want to do this to allow a non java application
    use openadaptor functionality.

    Run it like this...
    
      java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config adaptorws.xml -bean Adaptor
    
    You need the following in your classpath
  
      lib
      lib/openadaptor.jar
      lib/openadaptor-spring.jar
      lib/openadaptor-depends.jar
      lib/3rdparty/activation.jar
     
    Once it is running it will echo the webservice endpoint to the log, you can put
    this into a web browser and verify that you can see the wsdl.
  
    To test it fully you can run the other example which processes data by invoking
    a webservice.
