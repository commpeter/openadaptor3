<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>These instructions provide a step by step guide to getting started with
openadaptor. They require the reader to be able to install openadaptor 
and JAVA, if it is not already installed.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>Paths are documented in *nix notation, i.e. "/" rather than "\".</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>openadaptor requires the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) to be installed. 
From the command prompt type the following to see what verison if any is installed.</p>
<pre>
  java -version
</pre>
<p>If the JRE is installed and your PATH environment variable includes the JAVA bin directory then
you should see the version information. openadaptor is currently built and tested with the 
following version</p>
<pre>
  1.4.2
</pre>
<p>If you do not have JAVA installed or do not have a version prior to 1.4.x then you need to install 
a version of the JRE or JDK. Please refer to <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www/java.com</a></p>

<a name="installation"/>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The software for openadaptor is distributed as a zip file. In order to install it you will need
to download the zip and unzip the contents. The installation should look like this.</p>

<pre>
  opendaptor-X.Y.Z
   |
   |-doc              // this contains the java API documentation, launch index.html
   |  
   |- example         // README.txt and ant build file to compile code examples
   |   |
   |   |- bin         // scripts to set your JAVACLASSPATH
   |   |- spring      // spring framework example files
   |   |- src         // java code examples
   |   |- doc         // html documentation of spring examples
   |   |- tools       // 
   |
   |- lib             // openadaptor jar files and log4j properties file
   |   |
   |   |- 3rdparty    // 3rdparty jars/zips unpon which openadaptor and the examples depends
   |
   |- sql             // database schema and example files          
</pre>

<h2>Setting your JAVA CLASSPATH</h2>
<p>Since openadaptor is is written in Java you need to set your Java CLASSPATH for things to 
work.</p>

<p>The nature of what openadaptor does means that it ships with a large number of 3rd party
jars, these can be found in lib/3rdparty. Some of these are used by the framework but many 
of these relate to the different things it is capable of connecting to and the different 
data formats it can process. 
To make your life easy we have collated the majority of the third party jars
into a single jar called <code>openadaptor-depends.jar</code> (This contains a manifest
with the version of the 3rdparty jars that are included).</p>

<p>For most of the examples that we provide it it sufficient to set your CLASSPATH with 
the following jars.</p>

<pre>
  lib/openadaptor.jar          // the openadaptor code
  lib/openadaptor-spring.jar   // spring specific helper classes
  lib/openadaptor-depends.jar  // subset of 3rd party jars upon which our core code depends
</pre>

<p>plus for the lib directory itself, so that the log4j log configuration is "picked up".</p>

<p>On of the ways in which Java will "pickup" it's CLASSPATH from an environment variable named
CLASSPATH. The following instructions show how to set this on both Windows and *nix.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<pre>
  set OPENADAPTOR_HOME=c:\openadaptor-X.Y.Z
  set CLASSPATH=%OPENADAPTOR_HOME%\lib;%OPENADAPTOR_HOME%\lib\openadaptor.jar;%OPENADAPTOR_HOME%\lib\openadaptor-spring.jar;%OPENADAPTOR_HOME%\lib\openadaptor-depends.jar
</pre>
   
<h3>*nix (bourne shell)</h3>
<pre>
  OPENADAPTOR_HOME=~/opendaptor-X.Y.Z
  CLASSPATH=$OPENADAPTOR_HOME/lib:$OPENADAPTOR_HOME/lib/openadaptor.jar:$OPENADAPTOR_HOME/lib/openadaptor-spring.jar:$OPENADAPTOR_HOME/lib/openadaptor-depends.jar
  export CLASSPATH
</pre>

<p>Alternatively the example/bin directory contains 2 scripts for setting your CLASSPATH with absolute paths.
The following instructions show how to run the respective scripts on both Windows and *nix.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<pre>
  cd example\bin
  .\setclasspath.bat
  echo %CLASSPATH%
</pre>

<h3>*nix (bourne shell)</h3>
<pre>
  cd example/bin
  source setclasspath.sh
  echo $CLASSPATH
</pre>


<a name="verify"/>
<h2>Verifying the installation</h2>
<p>The best way to validate the previous steps it to run an adaptor. Here are the instructions</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<pre>
  cd example\spring\adaptor
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config simple.xml -bean Adaptor
</pre>

<h3>*nix (bourne shell)</h3>
<pre>
  cd example/spring/adaptor
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config simple.xml -bean Adaptor
</pre>

<p>If everything works you should see a flury of logging and the program should "sit there" waiting
for you to type something. If you type something then it should be echoed. Type Ctrl-C to quit to
shutdown the adaptor.</p>

<p>If it didn't work then you will probably see a "stack trace". The first things to check are
the command line you typed is correct and that your CLASSPATH is correct.</p>

<a name="spring"/>
<h2>The Spring Examples</h2>
<p>opendaptor classes are Java beans and we advocate using the spring framework to
assemble adaptors. The majority of our examples are provides as spring configuration files.</p>

<p>openadaptor provides a spring specific helper class for running adaptors as a standalone process.</p>
<pre>
  org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication
</pre>
  
<p>this expects the following arguments
<pre>
  -config <i>url</i>   : where url points to a spring config, defaults to file:
  -bean <i>id</i>      : where id is bean id of something that implements Runnable
  -props <i>url</i>    : (optional) url for properties file
  -jmx <i>port</i>     : (optional) if specified then runs default jmx mbean server and http adaptor
</pre>
  
<p>Here is how to run an adaptor using this class</p>
  
<pre>
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config example/spring/adaptor/simple.xml -bean Adaptor
</pre>
or
<pre>
  cd example/spring/adaptor
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringApplication -config simple.xml -bean Adaptor
</pre>

<p>Upon startup the adaptor will generate logging output according to it's logging configuration.
Note that a running adaptor may be stopped by typing Ctrl-C on the command line (both Windows & Unix). 
Under normal circumstances this should cause the adaptor to terminate gracefully.</p> 

<p>For more details on the examples look and the README in that directory and the header comments 
in the spring config file.</p>

<p>For more information on the spring framework refer to 
<a href="http://www.springframework.org">http://www.springframework.org</a></p>

<h2>The Code Examples</h2>
<p>The src dir contains code examples. The ant build file build.xml will compile these examples. 
In order to run the compiled examples you will need to set your classpath and include example/classes.
Please refer to <a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a> if you are not familiar
with ant.</p>
