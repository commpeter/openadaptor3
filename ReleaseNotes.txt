openadaptor 3.2.1.1
=======

Summary
=======
This is the second production release of openadaptor 3.2.1

The openadaptor white paper can be downloaded from:

https://www.openadaptor.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf


This release focuses on fixing defects and some enhancements.

================================================================================


Enhancements
============

Documentation

  Jboss environment - 'Environment' section was added to the example/readme.html
  detailing versions of the JBoss application server successfully tested to work
  with those openadaptor examples that require a JMS implementation.


Configuration

  SpringApplication and SpringAdaptor have been enhanced to substitute for 
  system properties. Properties resources can be specified on the command line
  using one or more "-props <resource-name>" arguments. This is now the default
  behaviour. Default 3.2.1 behaviour can be reinstated by supplying "- noprops"
  as a command line argument.


Database

  TableStatementConverter has been modified to issue a warning and throw a 
  RecordFormatException when an incoming ordered map contains more fields than
  the output table it is writing to.


General Enhancements

  Legacy JMS 1.0.2 compliant connection code has been removed. We see no 
  advantage in maintaining this going forward.

  The Pipeline class has been refactored as a trivial subclass of Router. It is
  likely to be deprecated from the next release - Router already implements all
  of its behaviour and can be configured similarly if desired.

  PreparedStatementTableConverter has been added. This can offer significant 
  performance improvements over previous mechanisms by reusing a prepared 
  statement for multiple written data records.

  The exception manager/store has been temporarily removed. We intend to 
  refactor this to be easier to use and less reliant on webservices. In
  the meantime, exception handling and re-routing works as before using standard
  components. 

  We have begun the process of replacing usage of ISimpleRecord with Map
  instances. Ultimately this should allow generic processors which operate on 
  standard Maps.
 
  JDBCWriteConnector now allows preamble and postamble SQL to be executed before
  the connector starts processing records and after it finishes processing the
  last records, respectively.

  ScriptableSimpleRecord has been enhanced to support returned Object[] values.


Packaging

  The webservice tests have been removed as they are failing due to differences
  in the running environment. New tests will appear in due  course.


Defects

  SC13  Bug in OrderedMapToXmlConvertor - Conversion would fail if key could not
        be cast to a string as it used (String)key. Modified to use
        key.toString() instead which is considerably more optimistic.

  SC14  Bug in OrderedMapToDelimitedStringConvertor This was failing to convert
        non-String value objects to delimited strings. Now uses toString() to
        obtain its String representation

  SC15  Bug in Dom4J simple record processora - this would have failed if an
        attempt to put(key,null) was made.

  SC16  Bug in AbstractDelimitedStringConvertor - The mechanism for splitting
        strings was inconsistent; one character long delimiters were treated as
        either literal strings or regular expressions depending on the 
        delimited strings having quoted blocks in them.(blocks of text not to
        be broken up by the convertor even if they contained the delimiter)
        Users to specify via bean properties if the delimiter is to be always
        treated as a regular expression or always as a delimited string. For
        the default behaviour a one character delimiter (anticipated to be the
        case in most situations) is used as a literal string whereas longer
        delimiters are interpreted as regular expressions.
 
  SC17  Bug in AbstractDelimitedStringConvertor - it was dropping
        trailing empty elements.
        
  SC18  Null values in returned data will cause data to be lost. Fixed.
        
  SC19  OrderedMapToXMLConvertor could inadvertently have introduced illegal tag
        names in the generated XML. This would occur if an incoming key name
        contained a forward slash (/) character, which is illegal in XML tag
        names. Unfortunately dom4j does not detect this, and will generate XML
        with the illegal tag names. Subsequent parsing of the generated XML will
        fail however, by virtue of the illegal key name. Consequently, the
        mappedSlashValue property has been added. This specifies the value that
        will be substituted in place of slash characters in generated key names.
        By default this is implicitly set to DEFAULT_SLASH_SUBSTITUTE. Note that
        if the mappedSlashValue property is not explicitly set, a warning will
        issue each time a slash has been implicitly mapped (explicitly setting
        the mapped value will prevent such warnings).
