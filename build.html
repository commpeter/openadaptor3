<h1>The build files</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>build.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Compiles everything in the work area, runs junit tests and verification targets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>package.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Creates a distribution archive from a compiled work area, does not actually do the compilation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>release.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Checks out a clean work area from the revision control system and then invokes build.xml and package.xml.</td>
  </tr>
</table>     

<h1>The default targets</h1>

<p>You can use <code>ant -p</code> to see the important targets of the respective files but all of these 
  have sensible default targets. The following commands are normally sufficient.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant [-f build.xml]</pre></div></td>
    <td>Performs a clean compile and runs all the tests.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant -f package.xml</pre></div></td>
    <td>Creates a distribution area (in a temp directory called package), re-runs the tests and "spits out" a zip file
    (<b>NOTE:</b> it will not compile the work area).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant -f release.xml</pre></div></td>
    <td>"Checks out" a new work area from subversion (in a temp directory called checkout), compiles ,tests and packages it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>As a developer you normally only invoke <code>build.xml</code>. Invoking <code>package.xml</code> 
and <code>release</code>.xml in your local workarea is really only applicable for testing the release 
process. See the next section for how to build a release for "general consumption".</p> 

<p>The compilation and packaging is parameterized by an ant property called "tag". This affects
the version number that is embedded in the openadpator.jar file, the javadocs, the directory
structure and name of the distribution zip. If you do not specify the tag property then is
gets set to "untagged", the resultant zip file will be called <code>openadaptor-untagged-bin.zip</code>, 
 the root directory structure will be <code>openadaptor-untagged</code> and the release will echo the
  following log line</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.tag = untagged
</pre></div>

<p>This reflects the fact that the distribution is based on your local workarea and is of indeterminate
version.</p>
  
<h1>Building releases</h1>

<p>If you want to create a release you should use <code>release.xml</code>, this will checkout a workarea from 
subversion and invoke <code>build.xml</code> and <code>package.xml</code>. As part of the checkout 
it generates  a file called <code>checkout.properties</code> in the checkout area. This will be 
automatically sourced when <code>build.xml</code> and <code>package.xml</code> are invoked in the 
workarea. Basically it sets the value for the <code>tag</code> property.</p> 
  
<p>If you invoke release.xml like this...</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  ant -f release.xml
</pre></div>
  
<p>then the workarea will be based on the trunk and hence the resulting output will be 
  <code>openadaptor-trunk-bin.zip</code> this is typically used to provide daily build.</p>

<p>Versioned releases relate to specific subversion tags. If you invoke release.xml like this..</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  ant -f release.xml -Dtag=3.2.1
</pre></div>
  
<p>then the workarea will be based on that tag and hence the resulting output will be 
  <code>openadaptor-3.2.1-bin.zip</code></p>.
